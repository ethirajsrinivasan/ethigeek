            <div class="section-heading">Story</div>
            <div class="section-body">When I was doing my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering one of my professors asked me build a site for an conference that was held in our college. It all started from there, I started loving designing websites and my CS course work gave me required skills to put my designs live. My genuine interest in understand people pushed me completely into designing products for that solves their day to day problems using design and tech. Seeing my passion my professor recommended me for different design project they came across. That led me to do many freelance projects and even run my own web design agency for a period. Taking my experience in design, I joining Web 2.0 Innovation labs, TCS Chennai as UX Designer. There I contributed to research, design, prototype, as well as front-end development for 3 years. However, I wanted to get more formal education in the user-centered design process for creating enhanced user experience. With this in mind, I joined Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) MS program at the University of Washington.
            <br>
            <br>
            Having a Computer Science background, being a UX designer &amp; Front-end developer for 3+ years and a masterâ€™s degree in HCDE make me a UX Unicorn. Being a computer science engineer give me an edge over regular UX designer as I can talk to a developer in engineering term and also understand technology limitations. This makes me a critical and strong team member at times a bridge between designers and developers.
              <br>I am looking forward to emerging my zeal for creating delightful and intuitive user experience design as well as interaction design.

          <div class="section-body">
            I hand-coded this website using different open source technologies like Angular.js, CSS, HTML, Ruby On Rails and Mongo DB. My primary goal is to utilize different open source free resource to build my portfolio. I wrote a detailed blogpost about how I built this website, don't forget to checkout the <a href="http://blog.websiddu.com/my-website-is-build-on-open-source/" target="_blank">blogpost here.</a>
            <br>
            <br>This website is completely <span class="text-normal">responsive and accessible</span>. I worked hard for making this website accessible. I wrote a <a href="http://blog.websiddu.com/how-i-implemented-accessibility-for-my-portfolio-website/" target="_blank">blogpost</a> about how I made my portfolio website accessible. Most of the development tasks are automated using grunt and python scripts. You can checkout the source code of my portfolio <a href="http://github.com/websiddu/websiddu" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
            <span class="text-normal">PS:</span> There are many hidden fun easter eggs in this site have fun finding them :)
